# Magnetic-Nanowire-Dynamics-Simulation
MATLAB simulation code for predicting 2D rotational alignment dynamics of magnetic nanowire fillers in a viscous fluid under an external magnetic field and the resulting changes in electrical properties (conductivity/resistance, permittivity/capacitance) based on Effective Medium Theory (EMT).
